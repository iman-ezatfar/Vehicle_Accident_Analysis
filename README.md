# **About the Project**

I utilized **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio** to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on both the **Vehicle** and **Accident** databases. Throughout this project, I executed a range of SQL queries, from basic to intermediate, to address the following distinct research questions.

## **Business Questions**
- **Question 1:** How many accidents have occurred in urban areas versus rural areas?
- **Question 2:** Which day of the week has the highest number of accidents?
- **Question 3:** What is the average age of vehicles involved in accidents based on their type?
- **Question 4:** Can we identify any trends in accidents based on the age of the vehicles involved?
- **Question 5:** Are there any specific weather conditions that contribute to severe accidents?
- **Question 6:** Do accidents often involve impacts on the left-hand side of vehicles?
- **Question 7:** Are there any relationships between journey purposes and the severity of accidents?
- **Question 8:** Calculate the average age of vehicles involved in accidents, considering daylight and point of impact.

## **Introduction to Project**

This project aims to explore the relationships between various factors in accident data, focusing on vehicle and environmental conditions that contribute to accidents.

## **Dataset**
The dataset includes accident data with information about vehicles involved, accident severity, locations, weather conditions, and other contributing factors.

## **Create & Import Databases and Tables**
- **Vehicle Table:** Contains information about the vehicles involved in accidents.
- **Accident Table:** Includes data about each accident, such as the severity, location, and conditions at the time of the accident.

## **Language / Tools**
- **SQL**
- **SQL Server**
- **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio**
